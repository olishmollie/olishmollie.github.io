These are some projects I did that I like. Many of them are interpreters. I get a kick out of writing interpreters.

<a href="https://github.com/olishmollie/fig">Fig</a>.
  The token Scheme implementation. I'm proud of this one because it's in C99 and I implemented a tracing garbage collector for it. I love the name, too. I wrote a Go port of it called GoFig. Yessssssss.

<a href="https://github.com/olishmollie/passman">Passman</a>.
  I love command-line tools. I don't know why. I was trying to find a good terminal-based password manager, but the ones I found had steep learning curves and were slow. So I wrote my own, and I still use it. It's faster than <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">Pass</a>, and has a better installation and setup experience.

<a href="https://github.com/olishmollie/lc3-as">Lc3-as</a>.
  I found a great <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/">tutorial</a> on writing your own VM that modeled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. I followed it eagerly, and after it was done I decided to build an assembler for it. I learned a lot, especially about trap routines, assembly language, and, well, assemblers. Still working on the linker and C compiler.

<a href="https://github.com/olishmollie/orng">Orng</a>.
  I was looking for a project to do in C++, and when I saw Rob Pike's <a href="https://github.com/robpike/ivy">Ivy</a>, I knew I had found one. It was also a great introduction to APL.

<a href="https://github.com/olishmollie/Wavecastr">WaveCastr</a>.
  Before I went back to college, I attended a development bootcamp. Our end of term project was WaveCastr, a podcasting app that records several guests in the browser simultaneously and saves the audio to an AWS bucket. It was backed by Rails and websockets, and it turned out great. It was also a very rewarding team experience. Shout out to Alex Raubach.
