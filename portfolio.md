[AggieSat 6](https://aggiesat.tamu.edu):
We're participating in the University NanoSatellite Program and aiming to launch our RF payload into space sometime in 2022. I'm on the EPS (Electrical Power System) team, designing circuits that will help power our satellite throughout its mission.

[Fig](https://github.com/olishmollie/fig):
The token Scheme implementation. I'm proud of this one because it's in C99 and I implemented a tracing garbage collector for it. I love the name, too. I wrote a Go port of it called GoFig. Yessssssss.

[Passman](https://github.com/olishmollie/passman)
I was trying to find a good terminal-based password manager, but the ones I found had steep learning curves and were slow. So I wrote my own, and I still use it. It's faster than <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">Pass</a>, and has a better installation and setup experience.

[Lc3-as](https://github.com/olishmollie/lc3-as)
I found a great <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/">tutorial</a> on writing your own VM that modeled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. I followed it eagerly, and after it was done I decided to build an assembler for it. I learned a lot, especially about trap routines, assembly language, and, well, assemblers. Still working on the linker and C compiler.

[Orng](https://github.com/olishmollie/orng)
I was looking for a project to do in C++, and when I saw Rob Pike's <a href="https://github.com/robpike/ivy">Ivy</a>, I knew I had found one. It was also a great introduction to APL.
