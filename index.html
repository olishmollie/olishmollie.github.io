    <h2>Milto's Mediterranean Cafe</h2>
    <p>
      This is by far my favorite Austin pizza joint. Locally owned and operated since 1977, Milto's combines great food, service, and atmosphere at an affordable price. Conveniently located in central Austin, stop by during lunch for an eggplant parm or the best Greek salad this side of the Aegean Sea.

    <h2>Conan's Pizza</h2>
    <p>
      If Chicago style deep-dish is more your speed, look no further than Conan's Pizza. A true Austin original, Conan's is known for its deep pan wheat dough, its everything pizza (the Savage), and a unique decorative flair; the walls are decked with racy comic book art and memorabilia. All in all, a great place to meet locals and have a slice.

    <h2>Bufalina Pizza</h2>
    <p>
      Boasting a wood-fire oven that burns hotter than 900 degrees, Bufalina proves that authentic Neopolitan style pizza still appeals to mainstream pizza eaters. Using ingredients imported from southern Italy, their pizza simply tastes great. They also have an impressive wine and beer selection.

    <h2>A Similar Webpage</h2>
    <h3>Scott's Pizza Journal</h3>
    <p>
      A <a href="http://blog.scottspizzatours.com">tumbler</a> all about pizza. I'm not a huge fan of the one page endless scroll, and there's something about the title I don't like (too plain?). The good thing about websites like these is that they look pretty great. The bad thing is that they all look the same.
