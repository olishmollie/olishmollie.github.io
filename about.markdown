I was born in Austin. I have an identical twin brother, Brendan. I moved to New York City when I was eighteen to study classical percussion at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/mannes/">Mannes College of Music</a>. It didn't work out, but I stayed to pursue songwriting. I ended up playing drums in a band that had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5VNumNJyqE">hit song</a> and got to tour around the world for a few years. After a while I got into a well known <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com">video game</a>, which got me into programming. Eventually I wanted to know more about computation, so in 2017 I moved back to Texas and enrolled at <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/">Austin Community College</a>, one of the best community colleges in the country. The next year I was accepted to and enrolled at A&M. While at A&M, I discovered a love for applied mathematics and electronics. I'm studying electrical engineering, with a minor (possibly a double major) in computer science. I will graduate in December, 2021.

Outside of school, I do a lot of toy projects in programming languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go (see my <a href="/~ajbond/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>). You can find my Github at the bottom of the page. For those of you that want to know, my text editor of choice is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, but I use Vim keybindings. I still write songs, but not as often as I used to. I also like playing pool. I captained an amateur team in the <a href="https://poolplayers.com">American Pool Association</a> for a few years called Palvin Poolidge. We were consistently one of the top five teams in our league. I also follow the English pocket billiards game Snooker. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2rFMPN9js">great video</a> of the legendary Englishman Ronnie O'Sullivan making a maximum break in five minutes, a record that will probably never be broken.

In short, I like to make things. The composition of small, well-understood elements into something new has always appealed to me, which why I like music, math, circuits and programming. Thanks for reading.
