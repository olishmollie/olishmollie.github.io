I was born in Austin. I have an identical twin brother, Brendan. I moved to New York City when I was eighteen to study classical percussion at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/mannes/">Mannes College of Music</a>. It didn't work out, but I stayed in New York to pursue music for a while. I played drums in a band that had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5VNumNJyqE">hit song</a> and got to tour around the country and the world for a few years. After a while I got into a well known <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com">video game</a>, which led me to start programming. Programming in turn led me to decide to go back to school, and in 2017 I moved back to Texas and enrolled at <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/">Austin Community College</a>, one of the best community colleges in the country. The next year I was accepted to and enrolled at A&M. I'm studying electrical engineering, but I want to double major in computer science. I will graduate in December, 2021.

Outside of school, I do a lot of toy projects in programming languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go. You can find my personal Github at the bottom of the page. My text editor of choice is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, but I use Vim keybindings. I also like playing pool. I captained an amateur team in the <a href="https://poolplayers.com">American Pool Association</a> for a few years called Palvin Poolidge. We were consistently one of the top five teams in our league. But if I had my way, we'd all start playing the English pocket billiards game Snooker. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2rFMPN9js">great video</a> of the legendary Ronnie O'Sullivan making a maximum break in around five minutes.

All in all, I just really like to create things. The composition of small, well-understood elements into something new has always appealed to me, which I think is why I like music, circuits and programming. If you've gotten this far, you're probably hoping I wrap it up pretty soon. So I'll leave you with some good advice someone once gave me. Don't sweat the small stuff, and don't panic. Thanks for reading.
