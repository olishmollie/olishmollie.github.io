Welcome! I’m Andrew Bond, an electrical engineering student seeking to bring my passion and curiosity to a career in technology. I’ve excelled in classes including Computer Architecture, Digital Design, Circuits, Statistics, Data Structures & Algorithms, Electromagnetics, and Systems Programming. I also have strong communication skills and an excellent academic record.

I have a wide range of interests. I've won statewide gymnastics competitions, played drums in punk and indie bands, toured Europe, busked on the streets of New York, and matched wits with KUT's John Aeilli. I can't wait to apply my unique perspective, energy and intellect to challenging problems, learn as much as possible, and love every bit. Download my resume or get in touch with the links below.
