I’m an electrical engineering student seeking to begin a career where hardware meets software. I’ve excelled in classes including Computer Architecture, Digital Design, Circuits, Statistics, Data Structures & Algorithms, Electromagnetics, and Systems Programming. I also have strong communication skills and an excellent academic record.

Outside of school, I like to program in C, C++, Rust, and Go, and I'm working to deliver safe and reliable power to the AggieSat 6 nanosatellite, which will hopefully be launched in 2022. My portfolio contains details on these and other projects.

I have the talent, perspective, and people skills to make your organization better. Feel free to drop me a line, and thanks for reading.
