Welcome! I’m Andrew Bond, an electrical engineering student seeking to leverage my skills in analog and digital circuits, programming, and problem solving to learn what it really means to be an electrical engineer. I'm an outstanding student with a 4.0 GPA, have strong written and interpersonal communication skills, and thrive in a team setting.

Before university I won statewide gymnastics competitions, attended a classical music conservatory, toured Europe in a trendy indie band, busked on the streets of New York, and matched wits with KUT's John Aeilli. I can’t wait to bring my unique perspective, energy and intellect to challenging problems, learn as much as possible, and love every bit. Download my resume or get in touch with the links below.
