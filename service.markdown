    Too many Americans are willing to claim the rights of a free society without accepting its responsibilities. That's why I'm passionate about getting people registered to vote. Visit <a href="https://stuactonline.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/2032">Aggies Vote</a> or <a href="https://www.brazoscountytx.gov/141/Voter-Registration">the county website</a> to get registered and participate in what Lincoln called the great American experiment.

    Don't take the Republic for granted.
