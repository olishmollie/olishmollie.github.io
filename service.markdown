[TODO: put an image here. Lincoln memorial?]

Too many Americans are willing to claim the rights of a free society without accepting its responsibilities. I fear that a sense of entitlement and fatigue with partisan politics has caused many young people to take what Americans have for granted. That's why I'm passionate about getting young people registered to vote. Visit AggieVotes[TODO: put link here] to get yourself registered and assume your responsibility as a participant in what Lincoln called the great experiment. Freedom isn't free -- take heed before it's too late.
